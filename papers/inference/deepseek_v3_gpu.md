DeepSeek V3 demonstrates superior performance across most benchmarks, particularly in mathematical and coding tasks, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

## NVIDIA H200 GPU Performance

The NVIDIA H200 GPU offers significant improvements over the H100, including a 76% increase in memory (141 GB vs. 80 GB) and a 43% boost in memory bandwidth (4.8 TB/s vs. 3.35 TB/s). These enhancements make the H200 particularly well-suited for handling large models like DeepSeek V3, which utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and supports FP8 training for efficient inference.

The table below summarizes the performance of DeepSeek V3 (BF16) on the H200 GPU:

| Machine | Batch (Req) | GPU          | VRAM         | Tokens/sec | TTFT (ms)   | TPOT (ms)  |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| 1       | 1           | H200 x 8     | 141GB x 8    | 639.99     | 587         | 209        |
| 1       | 8           | H200 x 8     | 141GB x 8    | 2249.03    | 1191        | 516        |

### Notes:
- **Machine**: Represents the machine configuration (single-node or multi-node).
- **Batch (Req)**: Number of requests processed in a batch.
- **GPU**: GPU configuration used for inference.
- **VRAM**: Total video memory available across GPUs.
- **Tokens/sec**: Token generation rate per second.
- **TTFT (ms)**: Time to First Token in milliseconds.
