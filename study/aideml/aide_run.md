## Example Usage

To illustrate how the `run.py` script operates within the AIDE framework, let's walk through a practical example. This example demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of developing a machine learning model for predicting house prices, from code generation and execution to tracking and reporting.

### Scenario: Developing a Machine Learning Model for Predicting House Prices

Imagine you're tasked with building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms. Using AIDE's `run.py`, you can automate the process of generating different model iterations, executing them, tracking their performance, and compiling a comprehensive report of your findings.

### Sample Execution

1. **Configuration Setup**

   Before running the script, ensure you have a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) that defines parameters such as experiment name, workspace directory, number of agent steps, model settings, and report generation preferences.

   ```yaml
   exp_name: "HousePricePrediction"
   workspace_dir: "./workspace/HousePricePrediction"
   log_dir: "./logs/HousePricePrediction"
   agent:
     steps: 5
     search:
       num_drafts: 2
       debug_prob: 0.2
       max_debug_depth: 3
   exec:
     timeout: 60
   report:
     model: "gpt-4"
     temp: 0.7
   generate_report: true
   ```

2. **Execution Command**

   Run the `run.py` script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

3. **Workflow Overview**

   - **Initialization**: The script loads configurations, sets up the workspace, and initializes the `Journal`, `Agent`, and `Interpreter`.
   - **Execution Loop**: The `Agent` generates code snippets based on the task description and previous iterations. The `Interpreter` executes these snippets, capturing outputs and handling exceptions.
   - **Progress Monitoring**: A live UI displays the current progress, solution tree, and relevant directories for monitoring.
   - **Reporting**: Upon completion, a comprehensive markdown report summarizing all iterations and findings is generated and saved.

### Expected Output

Upon successful execution, the script provides a rich, interactive UI showcasing the development progress and a final report detailing the model's evolution.

#### Console Output

```plaintext
Starting run "HousePricePrediction"
Preparing agent workspace (copying and extracting files) ...
AIDE is working on experiment: "HousePricePrediction"
Press Ctrl+C to stop the run
Generating final report from journal...
## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as size, location, and number of rooms. The primary objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately estimates house prices, facilitating informed decision-making in the real estate market.

## Preprocessing

The dataset was loaded using Pandas, selecting relevant features including size, location, and number of rooms as predictors. The target variable was defined as the house price. No additional data cleaning or feature engineering was performed, assuming the data was already preprocessed and ready for modeling.

## Modeling Methods

### Initial Model: Linear Regression

A basic Linear Regression model was implemented to establish a baseline performance. This model captures the linear relationships between the input features and the target variable.

### Improved Model: Random Forest Regressor

To enhance model performance, the Random Forest Regressor was employed. This ensemble method captures non-linear relationships and interactions between features, providing a more flexible and robust prediction capability.

## Results Discussion

The initial Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of 0.75, indicating a decent fit to the data. However, recognizing the limitations of linear models in capturing complex relationships, the Random Forest Regressor was introduced. This improved model achieved an R² score of 0.85, demonstrating a significant enhancement in predictive performance.

## Future Work

Future iterations could explore hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and the incorporation of additional data sources to further improve model accuracy. Additionally, deploying the model in a real-world setting and integrating it with a user-friendly interface would enhance its practical utility.

Report written to file: ./logs/HousePricePrediction/report.md
```

#### Live UI Visualization

The live UI displays the task description, progress bar, status messages, and a tree visualization of solution iterations. It also provides quick access to result visualization, workspace directory, and log directory.

![Live UI Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Live+UI+Example)

*Note: The actual UI will be rendered in the terminal with rich formatting.*

### Generated Report

The final report, saved as `report.md` in the log directory, summarizes all development steps, code snippets, execution results, and performance metrics.

## Best Practices and Key Takeaways

When utilizing AIDE's `run.py` script, adhering to best practices ensures that your AI development workflows are efficient, organized, and maintainable.

1. **Structured Configuration Management**:
   - **Utilize Configuration Files**: Define all experiment parameters, workspace settings, and agent configurations in structured YAML or JSON files.
   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     exp_name: "HousePricePrediction"
     workspace_dir: "./workspace/HousePricePrediction"
     log_dir: "./logs/HousePricePrediction"
     agent:
       steps: 5
       search:
         num_drafts: 2
         debug_prob: 0.2
         max_debug_depth: 3
     exec:
       timeout: 60
     report:
       model: "gpt-4"
       temp: 0.7
     generate_report: true
     ```

2. **Comprehensive Journal Tracking**:
   - **Log All Iterations**: Ensure that every code generation and execution step is recorded in the `Journal` for accurate tracking and reporting.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     node = Node(
         code="model.fit(X_train, y_train)",
         plan="Train the model using the training dataset."
     )
     journal.append(node)
     ```

3. **Regular Progress Saving**:
   - **Persist Journal State**: Use `save_run(cfg, journal)` within the execution loop to regularly save the state of the journal, preventing data loss in case of interruptions.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     while global_step < cfg.agent.steps:
         agent.step(exec_callback=exec_callback)
         save_run(cfg, journal)
         global_step = len(journal)
         live.update(generate_live())
     ```

4. **Effective Exception Handling**:
   - **Monitor Buggy Nodes**: Utilize the `is_buggy` flag within nodes to identify and address issues promptly, ensuring the robustness of your solutions.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     if node.is_buggy:
         handle_bug(node)
     ```

5. **Leverage Live UI for Monitoring**:
   - **Real-Time Feedback**: Utilize the live UI to monitor progress, view the solution tree, and access important directories, enhancing situational awareness during execution.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     with Live(
         generate_live(),
         refresh_per_second=16,
         screen=True,
     ) as live:
         # Execution loop
     ```

6. **Automated Reporting**:
   - **Generate Reports Post-Execution**: Enable `generate_report` in the configuration to automatically create comprehensive reports summarizing all development steps and findings.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     if cfg.generate_report:
         report = journal2report(journal, task_desc, cfg.report)
         with open(report_file_path, "w") as f:
             f.write(report)
     ```

7. **Workspace Cleanup**:
   - **Automate Cleanup**: Register cleanup functions using `atexit` to ensure that temporary files and directories are removed upon completion or interruption.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     def cleanup():
         if global_step == 0:
             shutil.rmtree(cfg.workspace_dir)
     
     atexit.register(cleanup)
     ```

**Key Takeaways**:

- **Automation Enhances Efficiency**: Automating code generation, execution, tracking, and reporting significantly reduces manual effort and minimizes errors.
- **Structured Tracking Facilitates Improvement**: Maintaining a detailed `Journal` allows for systematic improvements and easy identification of successful strategies.
- **Real-Time Monitoring Improves Management**: Live UI components provide immediate insights into the development process, enabling proactive management and quick decision-making.
- **Comprehensive Reporting Aids Documentation**: Automated reports ensure that all aspects of the AI development process are well-documented, facilitating reproducibility and knowledge sharing.
