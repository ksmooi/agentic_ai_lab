## Example Usage

To illustrate how the `backend/utils.py` module operates within the AIDE framework, let's walk through a practical example. This example demonstrates handling API requests with retries, formatting messages, and defining function specifications for structured interactions.

### Scenario: Handling API Requests with Retries

Imagine you're developing an AI assistant that interacts with OpenAI's language model to generate technical summaries and extract key metrics. Ensuring reliable communication with the API is crucial, especially in the face of transient errors like rate limits or connection issues. The utilities provided in `backend/utils.py` facilitate this by implementing retry mechanisms, message formatting, and function specifications.

### Sample Code

```python
from backend.utils import (
    backoff_create,
    opt_messages_to_list,
    compile_prompt_to_md,
    FunctionSpec
)
import openai

# Define a sample function specification
metrics_function = FunctionSpec(
    name="extract_metrics",
    json_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "accuracy": {"type": "number"},
            "precision": {"type": "number"},
            "recall": {"type": "number"}
        },
        "required": ["accuracy", "precision", "recall"]
    },
    description="Extract key performance metrics from the summary."
)

# Define system and user messages
system_msg = "You are an AI assistant that provides concise technical summaries."
user_msg = "Summarize the latest research on neural network optimization techniques."

# Convert messages to list format
messages = opt_messages_to_list(system_msg, user_msg)

# Define model parameters
model_kwargs = {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "max_tokens": 500,
    "functions": [metrics_function.as_openai_tool_dict],
    "function_call": metrics_function.openai_tool_choice_dict
}

# Define a function to create the OpenAI completion
def create_completion(messages, **kwargs):
    return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        messages=messages,
        **kwargs
    )

# Execute the API request with retry mechanism
try:
    completion = backoff_create(
        create_completion,
        retry_exceptions=[openai.RateLimitError, openai.APIConnectionError],
        messages=messages,
        **model_kwargs
    )
    
    if completion:
        choice = completion.choices[0]
        if choice.message.function_call:
            # Extract function call arguments
            metrics = choice.message.function_call.arguments
            print("Extracted Metrics:", metrics)
        else:
            # Handle text output
            summary = choice.message.content
            print("Generated Summary:", summary)
    else:
        print("Failed to retrieve a valid response after retries.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Extracted Metrics: {
    "accuracy": 0.92,
    "precision": 0.89,
    "recall": 0.85
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Function Specification**:
    - Defines a `FunctionSpec` named `extract_metrics` with a JSON schema specifying required metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall.
    - This specification informs the language model to call this function with the necessary parameters.

2. **Message Formatting**:
    - Uses `opt_messages_to_list` to convert the system and user messages into a list of dictionaries with appropriate roles.
    - This ensures compatibility with OpenAI's API requirements.

3. **Model Parameters**:
    - Configures the language model (`gpt-4`) with a temperature of `0.5` for balanced creativity and coherence.
    - Sets `max_tokens` to `500` to limit the response length.
    - Includes the function specification in the `functions` parameter and instructs the model to call the specified function using `function_call`.

4. **API Request Execution**:
    - Defines `create_completion` as a wrapper around `openai.ChatCompletion.create` to facilitate the API call.
    - Uses `backoff_create` to execute `create_completion` with a retry mechanism for handling `RateLimitError` and `APIConnectionError`.
    - If the API call is successful and a function call is detected in the response, it extracts and prints the metrics.
    - If only text is returned, it prints the generated summary.
    - If all retries fail, it notifies the user of the failure.

5. **Error Handling**:
    - Catches and prints any unexpected exceptions that occur during the API interaction.
