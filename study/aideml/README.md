## Core Philosophy and Objectives

At the heart of the AIDE library lies a set of core principles that guide its design and functionality:

1. **Modularity**: AIDE is constructed as a collection of interoperable modules, enabling users to select and integrate components that best fit their specific requirements. This modular approach fosters flexibility and ease of customization.

2. **Scalability**: Designed with performance in mind, AIDE accommodates projects of varying scales, from small prototypes to extensive, production-grade systems. Its architecture ensures that as your project grows, AIDE scales seamlessly alongside it.

3. **Accessibility**: AIDE lowers the entry barrier for newcomers with its clear documentation and intuitive APIs, while also catering to the advanced needs of experienced professionals. This dual focus ensures that a broad spectrum of users can effectively utilize the library.

4. **Extensibility**: The library is built to integrate effortlessly with external libraries and frameworks, ensuring compatibility with a wide array of tools in the AI ecosystem. This extensibility allows users to enhance and extend AIDE's capabilities as needed.

5. **Reliability**: Emphasizing robustness, AIDE incorporates extensive testing and optimization to minimize errors and ensure consistent performance across different environments and use cases.

### Algorithm Description

AIDE's problem-solving approach is inspired by how human data scientists tackle challenges. It starts by generating a set of initial solution drafts and then iteratively refines and improves them based on performance feedback. This process is driven by a technique we call **Solution Space Tree Search**.

At its core, **Solution Space Tree Search** consists of three main components:

- **Solution Generator**: This component proposes new solutions by either creating novel drafts or making changes to existing solutions, such as fixing bugs or introducing improvements.
- **Evaluator**: The evaluator assesses the quality of each proposed solution by running it and comparing its performance against the objective. This is implemented by instructing the LLM to include statements that print the evaluation metric and by having another LLM parse the printed logs to extract the evaluation metric.
- **Base Solution Selector**: The solution selector picks the most promising solution from the explored options to serve as the starting point for the next iteration of refinement.

By repeatedly applying these steps, AIDE navigates the vast space of possible solutions, progressively refining its approach until it converges on the optimal solution for the given data science problem.

## Usage

To effectively leverage the capabilities of the AIDE library, users can interact with it through various interfaces, including the command line, Python scripts, and development environments. This section provides detailed instructions on setting up and running AIDE using these different methods.

### Running AIDE via the Command Line

#### Setup

Ensure you have Python version 3.10 or higher installed. Begin by installing the `aideml` package:

```bash
pip install -U aideml
```

Additionally, install `unzip` to allow the agent to autonomously extract your data.

Set up your OpenAI (or Anthropic) API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

#### Running AIDE

Use the following command structure to run AIDE:

```bash
aide data_dir="<path to your data directory>" goal="<describe the agent's goal for your task>" eval="<(optional) describe the evaluation metric the agent should use>"
```

**Example:** To run AIDE on the [house price prediction task](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data):

```bash
aide data_dir="example_tasks/house_prices" goal="Predict the sales price for each house" eval="Use the RMSE metric between the logarithm of the predicted and observed values."
```

#### Options

- `data_dir` (required): A directory containing all the data relevant for your task (.csv files, images, etc.).
- `goal`: Describe what you want the models to predict in your task, for example, "Build a time series forecasting model for bitcoin close price" or "Predict sales price for houses".
- `eval`: The evaluation metric used to evaluate the ML models for the task (e.g., accuracy, F1, Root-Mean-Squared-Error, etc.).

Alternatively, you can provide the entire task description as a `desc_str` string, or write it in a plaintext file and pass its path as `desc_file` (see [example file](aide/example_tasks/house_prices.md)):

```bash
aide data_dir="my_data_dir" desc_file="my_task_description.txt"
```

#### Output

The result of the run will be stored in the `logs` directory:

- `logs/<experiment-id>/best_solution.py`: Python code of the *best solution* according to the validation metric.
- `logs/<experiment-id>/journal.json`: A JSON file containing the metadata of the experiment runs, including all the code generated in intermediate steps, plan, evaluation results, etc.
- `logs/<experiment-id>/tree_plot.html`: A visualization of the solution tree, detailing the experimentation process of finding and optimizing ML code. Open this file in your browser to explore and interact with the tree visualization.

The `workspaces` directory will contain all the files and data that the agent generated.

#### Advanced Usage

To further customize the behavior of AIDE, some useful options include:

- `agent.code.model=...` to configure which model the agent should use for coding (default is `gpt-4-turbo`).
- `agent.steps=...` to configure how many improvement iterations the agent should run (default is `20`).
- `agent.search.num_drafts=...` to configure the number of initial drafts the agent should generate (default is `5`).

You can check the [config.yaml](aide/utils/config.yaml) file for more options.

#### Using Local LLMs

AIDE supports using local LLMs through OpenAI-compatible APIs. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Set Up a Local LLM Server**: Use solutions like [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) or similar to set up a local LLM server with an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

2. **Configure Your Environment**:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"  # For Ollama
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="local-llm"  # Can be any string if your local server doesn't require authentication
   ```

3. **Update the Model Configuration**: Modify your AIDE command or config to use the local endpoint. For example, with Ollama:

   ```bash
   # Example with house prices dataset
   aide agent.code.model="qwen2.5" agent.feedback.model="qwen2.5" report.model="qwen2.5" \
       data_dir="example_tasks/house_prices" \
       goal="Predict the sales price for each house" \
       eval="Use the RMSE metric between the logarithm of the predicted and observed values."
   ```

### Using AIDE in Python

Integrating AIDE within your Python scripts or projects allows for more customized and programmatic control over experiments. Follow the setup steps mentioned above, then create and run an AIDE experiment as shown below:

```python
import aide

exp = aide.Experiment(
    data_dir="example_tasks/bitcoin_price",  # Replace with your own directory
    goal="Build a time series forecasting model for bitcoin close price.",  # Replace with your own goal description
    eval="RMSLE"  # Replace with your own evaluation metric
)

best_solution = exp.run(steps=10)

print(f"Best solution has validation metric: {best_solution.valid_metric}")
print(f"Best solution code: {best_solution.code}")
```

This script initializes an experiment with specified parameters, runs it for a defined number of steps, and then prints out the best solution's validation metric and corresponding code.

### Development

For those interested in contributing to AIDE or customizing it beyond standard usage, setting up a development environment is straightforward.

#### Installing AIDE for Development

Clone the AIDE repository and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WecoAI/aideml.git
cd aideml
pip install -e .
```

This setup allows you to make changes to the AIDE source code and have them reflected immediately without reinstalling the package.

#### Running the Web UI in Development Mode

AIDE includes a Web UI for easier interaction and monitoring. To run the Web UI in development mode:

1. **Ensure Development Dependencies are Installed**: Make sure all required dependencies for development are installed. This typically includes packages listed in `requirements-dev.txt` or similar files.

2. **Start the Web UI**:

   ```bash
   cd aide/webui
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This command launches the Web UI using Streamlit. Navigate to the provided local URL in your browser to access the interface.
