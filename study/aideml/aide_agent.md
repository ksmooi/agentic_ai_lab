review_func_spec = FunctionSpec(
    name="submit_review",
    json_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "is_bug": {
                "type": "boolean",
                "description": "true if the output log shows that the execution failed or has some bug, otherwise false.",
            },
            "summary": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "if there is a bug, propose a fix. Otherwise, write a short summary (2-3 sentences) describing the empirical findings.",
            },
            "metric": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "If the code ran successfully, report the value of the validation metric. Otherwise, leave it null.",

                "description": "true if the metric should be minimized (i.e. a lower metric value is better, such as with MSE), false if the metric should be maximized (i.e. a higher metric value is better, such as with accuracy).",
            },
        },
        "required": ["is_bug", "summary", "metric", "lower_is_better"],
    },
    description="Submit a review evaluating the output of the training script.",
)
```

- **Purpose**: Defines the structure and expectations for the `submit_review` function, which evaluates the output of a training script.
- **Components**:
  - **`name`**: The name of the function specification.
  - **`json_schema`**: Specifies the expected input and output structure, ensuring that the response adheres to a predefined format.
  - **`description`**: Provides a brief overview of the function's purpose.

### The `Agent` Class

The `Agent` class encapsulates the behavior and lifecycle management of AI agents within AIDE. Let's explore its components in detail.

#### Initialization (`__init__`)

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    task_desc: str,
    cfg: Config,
    journal: Journal,
):
    super().__init__()
    self.task_desc = task_desc
    self.cfg = cfg
    self.acfg = cfg.agent
    self.journal = journal
    self.data_preview: str | None = None
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `task_desc`: A description of the task the agent is intended to solve.
  - `cfg`: Configuration settings encapsulated in a `Config` object.
  - `journal`: An instance of the `Journal` class for tracking solution history and evaluation.

- **Attributes**:
  - `self.task_desc`: Stores the task description.
  - `self.cfg` and `self.acfg`: Store configuration settings, with `self.acfg` specifically referencing agent-related configurations.
  - `self.journal`: Manages the history and evaluation of solutions.
  - `self.data_preview`: Holds a preview of the data, initialized as `None`.

#### Search Policy (`search_policy`)

```python
def search_policy(self) -> Node | None:
    """Select a node to work on (or None to draft a new node)."""
    search_cfg = self.acfg.search

    # initial drafting
    if len(self.journal.draft_nodes) < search_cfg.num_drafts:
        logger.debug("[search policy] drafting new node (not enough drafts)")
        return None

    # debugging
    if random.random() < search_cfg.debug_prob:
        # nodes that are buggy + leaf nodes + debug depth < max debug depth
        debuggable_nodes = [
            n
            for n in self.journal.buggy_nodes
            if (n.is_leaf and n.debug_depth <= search_cfg.max_debug_depth)
        ]
        if debuggable_nodes:
            logger.debug("[search policy] debugging")
            return random.choice(debuggable_nodes)
        logger.debug("[search policy] not debugging by chance")

    # back to drafting if no nodes to improve
    good_nodes = self.journal.good_nodes
    if not good_nodes:
        logger.debug("[search policy] drafting new node (no good nodes)")
        return None

    # greedy
    greedy_node = self.journal.get_best_node()
    logger.debug("[search policy] greedy node selected")
    return greedy_node
```

- **Purpose**: Determines the next action for the agentâ€”whether to draft a new solution, debug an existing one, or improve a current solution.
- **Logic**:
  1. **Initial Drafting**: If the number of draft nodes is less than the configured number (`num_drafts`), the agent opts to draft a new node.
  2. **Debugging**: With a probability defined by `debug_prob`, the agent selects a buggy node to debug, provided it hasn't exceeded the maximum debug depth.
  3. **Greedy Improvement**: If there are good nodes available, the agent selects the best-performing node for further improvement.
  
- **Return Value**: A `Node` instance representing the selected node to work on or `None` to initiate drafting a new node.

#### Prompt Properties

The `Agent` class defines several properties that generate prompts for different stages of the agent's operation.

##### _prompt_environment

```python
@property
def _prompt_environment(self):
    pkgs = [
        "numpy",
        "pandas",
        "scikit-learn",
        "statsmodels",
        "xgboost",
        "lightGBM",
        "torch",
        "torchvision",
        "torch-geometric",
        "bayesian-optimization",
        "timm",
    ]
    random.shuffle(pkgs)
    pkg_str = ", ".join([f"`{p}`" for p in pkgs])

    env_prompt = {
        "Installed Packages": f"Your solution can use any relevant machine learning packages such as: {pkg_str}. Feel free to use any other packages too (all packages are already installed!). For neural networks we suggest using PyTorch rather than TensorFlow."
    }
    return env_prompt
```

- **Purpose**: Generates a prompt detailing the available machine learning packages that the agent can utilize.
- **Functionality**:
  - Shuffles the list of packages to introduce variability.
  - Formats the package list into a string suitable for inclusion in a prompt.
  
- **Usage**: Provides context to the agent about the available tools and libraries for solution implementation.

##### _prompt_impl_guideline

```python
@property
def _prompt_impl_guideline(self):
    impl_guideline = [
        "The code should **implement the proposed solution** and **print the value of the evaluation metric computed on a hold-out validation set**.",
        "The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.",
        "No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the before finishing the script.",
        "Your response should only contain a single code block.",
        f"Be aware of the running time of the code, it should complete within {humanize.naturaldelta(self.cfg.exec.timeout)}.",
        'All the provided input data is stored in "./input" directory.',
        '**If there is test data provided for this task, please save the test predictions in a `submission.csv` file in the "./working" directory as described in the task description** This is extremely important since this file is used for grading/evaluation. DO NOT FORGET THE submission.csv file!',
        'You can also use the "./working" directory to store any temporary files that your code needs to create.',
    ]
    if self.acfg.expose_prediction:
        impl_guideline.append(
            "The implementation should include a predict() function, "
            "allowing users to seamlessly reuse the code to make predictions on new data. "
            "The prediction function should be well-documented, especially the function signature."
        )

    if self.acfg.k_fold_validation > 1:
        impl_guideline.append(
            f"The evaluation should be based on {self.acfg.k_fold_validation}-fold cross-validation but only if that's an appropriate evaluation for the task at hand."
        )

    return {"Implementation guideline": impl_guideline}
```

- **Purpose**: Provides detailed guidelines for the implementation of solutions by the agent.
- **Components**:
  - **General Guidelines**: Ensures that the code is self-contained, executes within a specified timeout, and adheres to specific directory structures for data handling.
  - **Conditional Guidelines**: Depending on configuration settings (`expose_prediction` and `k_fold_validation`), additional guidelines are appended to cater to specific requirements like including a `predict()` function or implementing cross-validation.

##### _prompt_resp_fmt

```python
@property
def _prompt_resp_fmt(self):
    return {
        "Response format": (
            "Your response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (3-5 sentences), "
            "followed by a single markdown code block (wrapped in ```) which implements this solution and prints out the evaluation metric. "
            "There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block. "
        )
    }
```

- **Purpose**: Specifies the expected format of the agent's response, ensuring consistency and ease of parsing.
- **Components**: Instructs the agent to provide a natural language outline followed by a single markdown code block containing the implementation.

#### Plan and Code Query (`plan_and_code_query`)

```python
def plan_and_code_query(self, prompt, retries=3) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """Generate a natural language plan + code in the same LLM call and split them apart."""
    completion_text = None
    for _ in range(retries):
        completion_text = query(
            system_message=prompt,
            user_message=None,
            model=self.acfg.code.model,
            temperature=self.acfg.code.temp,
        )

        code = extract_code(completion_text)
        nl_text = extract_text_up_to_code(completion_text)

        if code and nl_text:
            # merge all code blocks into a single string
            return nl_text, code

        print("Plan + code extraction failed, retrying...")
    print("Final plan + code extraction attempt failed, giving up...")
    return "", completion_text  # type: ignore
```

- **Purpose**: Interacts with the language model (LLM) to generate a natural language plan and corresponding code, ensuring they are correctly extracted and separated.
- **Process**:
  1. **Query Execution**: Sends the prompt to the LLM using the configured model and temperature settings.
  2. **Extraction**: Utilizes utility functions to extract code blocks and the preceding natural language text from the LLM's response.
  3. **Retries**: Attempts the extraction process multiple times (default 3) in case of failures.
  
- **Return Value**: A tuple containing the natural language plan and the extracted code. If extraction fails after retries, returns an empty string for the plan and the raw `completion_text`.

#### Drafting a New Node (`_draft`)

```python
def _draft(self) -> Node:
    prompt: Any = {
        "Introduction": (
            "You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. "
            "In order to win this competition, you need to come up with an excellent and creative plan "
            "for a solution and then implement this solution in Python. We will now provide a description of the task."
        ),
        "Task description": self.task_desc,
        "Memory": self.journal.generate_summary(),
        "Instructions": {},
    }
    prompt["Instructions"] |= self._prompt_resp_fmt
    prompt["Instructions"] |= {
        "Solution sketch guideline": [
            "This first solution design should be relatively simple, without ensembling or hyper-parameter optimization.",
            "Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the design,"
            " don't propose the same modelling solution but keep the evaluation the same.",
            "The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.",
            "Propose an evaluation metric that is reasonable for this task.",
            "Don't suggest to do EDA.",
            "The data is already prepared and available in the `./input` directory. There is no need to unzip any files.",
        ],
    }
    prompt["Instructions"] |= self._prompt_impl_guideline
    prompt["Instructions"] |= self._prompt_environment

    if self.acfg.data_preview:
        prompt["Data Overview"] = self.data_preview

    plan, code = self.plan_and_code_query(prompt)
    return Node(plan=plan, code=code)
```

- **Purpose**: Initiates the creation of a new solution by drafting a plan and corresponding code.
- **Process**:
  1. **Prompt Construction**: Compiles a comprehensive prompt that includes:
     - **Introduction**: Sets the context as a Kaggle competition.
     - **Task Description**: Details of the problem to be solved.
     - **Memory**: Summary of past solutions and evaluations.
     - **Instructions**: Combines response format guidelines, solution sketch guidelines, implementation guidelines, and environment details.
     - **Data Overview**: (Optional) Includes a preview of the data if available.
  2. **LLM Interaction**: Calls `plan_and_code_query` to obtain the plan and code from the LLM.
  3. **Node Creation**: Returns a new `Node` instance containing the generated plan and code.
  
- **Return Value**: A `Node` object encapsulating the drafted plan and code.

#### Improving an Existing Node (`_improve`)

```python
def _improve(self, parent_node: Node) -> Node:
    prompt: Any = {
        "Introduction": (
            "You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. You are provided with a previously developed "
            "solution below and should improve it in order to further increase the (test time) performance. "
            "For this you should first outline a brief plan in natural language for how the solution can be improved and "
            "then implement this improvement in Python based on the provided previous solution. "
        ),
        "Task description": self.task_desc,
        "Memory": self.journal.generate_summary(),
        "Instructions": {},
    }
    prompt["Previous solution"] = {
        "Code": wrap_code(parent_node.code),
    }

    prompt["Instructions"] |= self._prompt_resp_fmt
    prompt["Instructions"] |= {
        "Solution improvement sketch guideline": [
            "The solution sketch should be a brief natural language description of how the previous solution can be improved.",
            "You should be very specific and should only propose a single actionable improvement.",
            "This improvement should be atomic so that we can experimentally evaluate the effect of the proposed change.",
            "Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the improvement.",
            "The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.",
            "Don't suggest to do EDA.",
        ],
    }
    prompt["Instructions"] |= self._prompt_impl_guideline

    plan, code = self.plan_and_code_query(prompt)
    return Node(
        plan=plan,
        code=code,
        parent=parent_node,
    )
```

- **Purpose**: Enhances an existing solution by proposing and implementing specific improvements.
- **Process**:
  1. **Prompt Construction**: Similar to `_draft`, but includes the `Previous solution` section containing the existing code.
  2. **Instructions**: Emphasizes proposing a single, actionable improvement and adhering to specific guidelines.
  3. **LLM Interaction**: Obtains the improvement plan and code.
  4. **Node Creation**: Returns a new `Node` instance linked to the parent node.
  
- **Return Value**: A `Node` object containing the improvement plan, code, and reference to the parent node.

#### Debugging a Node (`_debug`)

```python
def _debug(self, parent_node: Node) -> Node:
    prompt: Any = {
        "Introduction": (
            "You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. "
            "Your previous solution had a bug, so based on the information below, you should revise it in order to fix this bug. "
            "Your response should be an implementation outline in natural language,"
            " followed by a single markdown code block which implements the bugfix/solution."
        ),
        "Task description": self.task_desc,
        "Previous (buggy) implementation": wrap_code(parent_node.code),
        "Execution output": wrap_code(parent_node.term_out, lang=""),
        "Instructions": {},
    }
    prompt["Instructions"] |= self._prompt_resp_fmt
    prompt["Instructions"] |= {
        "Bugfix improvement sketch guideline": [
            "You should write a brief natural language description (3-5 sentences) of how the issue in the previous implementation can be fixed.",
            "Don't suggest to do EDA.",
        ],
    }
    prompt["Instructions"] |= self._prompt_impl_guideline

    if self.acfg.data_preview:
        prompt["Data Overview"] = self.data_preview

    plan, code = self.plan_and_code_query(prompt)
    return Node(plan=plan, code=code, parent=parent_node)
```

- **Purpose**: Addresses and fixes bugs in existing solutions.
- **Process**:
  1. **Prompt Construction**: Includes details about the buggy implementation and the execution output (error logs or output messages).
  2. **Instructions**: Directs the agent to focus solely on bug fixes without suggesting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  3. **LLM Interaction**: Retrieves the bug fix plan and corrected code.
  4. **Node Creation**: Returns a new `Node` linked to the parent node containing the buggy code.
  
- **Return Value**: A `Node` object with the bug fix plan, code, and reference to the parent node.

#### Updating Data Preview (`update_data_preview`)

```python
def update_data_preview(
    self,
):
    self.data_preview = data_preview.generate(self.cfg.workspace_dir)
```

- **Purpose**: Generates and updates a preview of the data from the specified workspace directory.
- **Functionality**: Calls the `generate` method from the `data_preview` utility to create a data overview, which can assist the agent in understanding the data structure and content.

#### Agent Step (`step`)

```python
def step(self, exec_callback: ExecCallbackType):
    if not self.journal.nodes or self.data_preview is None:
        self.update_data_preview()

    parent_node = self.search_policy()
    logger.debug(f"Agent is generating code, parent node type: {type(parent_node)}")

    if parent_node is None:
        result_node = self._draft()
    elif parent_node.is_buggy:
        result_node = self._debug(parent_node)
    else:
        result_node = self._improve(parent_node)

    self.parse_exec_result(
        node=result_node,
        exec_result=exec_callback(result_node.code, True),
    )
    self.journal.append(result_node)
```

- **Purpose**: Executes a single step in the agent's lifecycle, handling drafting, debugging, or improving solutions based on the search policy.
- **Process**:
  1. **Data Preview Check**: Ensures that data preview is available; if not, it updates it.
  2. **Search Policy**: Determines the next action by selecting an appropriate node.
  3. **Action Execution**:
     - **Drafting**: If no suitable node is found, drafts a new solution.
     - **Debugging**: If the selected node has bugs, initiates the debugging process.
     - **Improving**: Otherwise, proceeds to improve the existing solution.
  4. **Execution Callback**: Executes the generated code and obtains the execution result.
  5. **Result Parsing and Logging**: Parses the execution result and appends the new node to the journal.
  
- **Parameters**:
  - `exec_callback`: A callable that takes the generated code and executes it, returning an `ExecutionResult`.
  
#### Parsing Execution Results (`parse_exec_result`)

```python
def parse_exec_result(self, node: Node, exec_result: ExecutionResult):
    logger.info(f"Agent is parsing execution results for node {node.id}")

    node.absorb_exec_result(exec_result)

    prompt = {
        "Introduction": (
            "You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. "
            "You have written code to solve this task and now need to evaluate the output of the code execution. "
            "You should determine if there were any bugs as well as report the empirical findings."
        ),
        "Task description": self.task_desc,
        "Implementation": wrap_code(node.code),
        "Execution output": wrap_code(node.term_out, lang=""),
    }

    response = cast(
        dict,
        query(
            system_message=prompt,
            user_message=None,
            func_spec=review_func_spec,
            model=self.acfg.feedback.model,
            temperature=self.acfg.feedback.temp,
        ),
    )

    # if the metric isn't a float then fill the metric with the worst metric
    if not isinstance(response["metric"], float):
        response["metric"] = None

    node.analysis = response["summary"]
    node.is_buggy = (
        response["is_bug"]
        or node.exc_type is not None
        or response["metric"] is None
    )

    if node.is_buggy:
        node.metric = WorstMetricValue()
    else:
        node.metric = MetricValue(
            response["metric"], maximize=not response["lower_is_better"]
        )
```

- **Purpose**: Analyzes the results of the executed code to determine its performance and identify any bugs.
- **Process**:
  1. **Absorb Execution Results**: Incorporates the execution outcome (`exec_result`) into the node.
  2. **Prompt Construction**: Prepares a prompt that includes the task description, implementation code, and execution output.
  3. **LLM Interaction**: Queries the LLM using the `review_func_spec` to obtain a review of the execution results.
  4. **Response Handling**:
     - **Metric Validation**: Ensures that the reported metric is a float; otherwise, assigns `None`.
     - **Bug Detection**: Determines if the node is buggy based on the response and any exceptions.
     - **Metric Assignment**: Assigns the appropriate metric value, using the worst metric if bugs are detected.
  
- **Parameters**:
  - `node`: The `Node` instance containing the solution to be evaluated.
  - `exec_result`: The result of executing the node's code.

## Example Usage

To illustrate how the `Agent` class operates within the AIDE framework, consider the following hypothetical scenario:

### Scenario: Developing a Machine Learning Model for Predicting House Prices

1. **Initialization**:
    ```python
    from aide.agent import Agent
    from aide.config import Config
    from aide.journal import Journal

    task_description = "Predict house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms."
    config = Config.load("config.yaml")
    journal = Journal()

    agent = Agent(task_desc=task_description, cfg=config, journal=journal)
    ```

2. **Agent Step Execution**:
    ```python
    def execute_code(code: str, timeout: bool) -> ExecutionResult:
        # Function to execute the generated code and return the results
        # This is a placeholder for actual code execution logic
        pass

    agent.step(exec_callback=execute_code)
    ```

3. **Workflow**:
    - **Drafting**: Since the journal is empty, the agent drafts a new solution, generating a plan and corresponding code.
    - **Execution**: The generated code is executed via the `exec_callback`, producing metrics and any error logs.
    - **Parsing Results**: The agent parses the execution results to evaluate performance and detect bugs.
    - **Iteration**: Based on the feedback, the agent may improve the solution or debug existing issues, iterating until an optimal solution is achieved.

### Example Output

After executing several steps, the journal might contain a tree of nodes representing different solution iterations:

```plaintext
aide/
â””â”€â”€ journal/
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_1/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plan: "Implement a basic linear regression model."
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code: "import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n..."
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ metric: 0.85
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_2/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plan: "Improve model by adding polynomial features."
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code: "from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n..."
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ metric: 0.90
    â””â”€â”€ node_3/
        â”œâ”€â”€ plan: "Fix bug in data preprocessing step."
        â”œâ”€â”€ code: "def preprocess(data):\n    # Fixed code here\n..."
        â””â”€â”€ metric: WorstMetricValue()
```

In this example:
- **Node 1**: The initial linear regression model achieved a metric of 0.85.
- **Node 2**: The model was improved by adding polynomial features, increasing the metric to 0.90.
- **Node 3**: A bug was detected in the data preprocessing step, resulting in a `WorstMetricValue`.

This iterative process showcases how the `Agent` class facilitates continuous improvement and debugging of AI solutions.
