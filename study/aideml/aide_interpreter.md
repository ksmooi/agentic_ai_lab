## Introduction

Executing Python code snippets reliably and securely is a fundamental requirement in AI development workflows. Whether running training scripts, validating models, or performing data preprocessing, developers need tools that ensure code execution is efficient, error-resistant, and well-managed.

The `interpreter.py` module within the AIDE library fulfills this need by providing a sophisticated Python interpreter that:

- **Captures Standard Output and Errors**: Redirects `stdout` and `stderr` to queues for monitoring and logging.
- **Handles Exceptions Gracefully**: Captures exceptions and stack traces, supporting both standard Python and IPython traceback formats.
- **Enforces Execution Time Limits**: Implements timeout mechanisms to prevent long-running or stuck processes.

By offering these capabilities, `interpreter.py` ensures that AI development tasks are executed smoothly, with robust error handling and performance monitoring.

## Overview of `interpreter.py`

The `interpreter.py` script is designed to execute Python code snippets in a controlled environment. It achieves this by spawning a separate child process that runs the provided code, capturing its output, handling any exceptions, and enforcing execution time constraints.

### Key Features

- **Isolation**: Executes code in a separate process to prevent interference with the main application.
- **Output Capturing**: Redirects both `stdout` and `stderr` to queues for real-time monitoring.
- **Exception Handling**: Captures and summarizes exceptions, including stack traces, in both standard and IPython formats.
- **Timeout Enforcement**: Ensures that code execution does not exceed a specified time limit, terminating processes that run too long.
- **Configurable Environment**: Allows customization of the working directory, execution timeouts, and exception formatting.

---

## Detailed Explanation

Let's delve into the components and functionalities of the `interpreter.py` script to understand how it orchestrates secure and efficient code execution.

### Imports and Dependencies

```python
import logging
import os
import queue
import signal
import sys
import time
import traceback
from dataclasses import dataclass
from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
from pathlib import Path

import humanize
from dataclasses_json import DataClassJsonMixin
```

- **Standard Libraries**:
  - `logging`: For logging events, errors, and debug information.
  - `os`, `sys`, `signal`: For interacting with the operating system, handling signals, and managing processes.
  - `queue`: Implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues for thread-safe communication.
  - `time`, `traceback`: For tracking execution time and formatting stack traces.
  - `dataclasses`: For defining data classes.
  - `multiprocessing`: For creating and managing separate processes.
  - `pathlib`: For object-oriented filesystem paths.

- **Third-Party Libraries**:
  - `humanize`: Converts time durations into human-readable formats.
  - `dataclasses_json`: Provides JSON serialization for data classes.

### Data Class: `ExecutionResult`

```python
@dataclass
class ExecutionResult(DataClassJsonMixin):
    """
    Result of executing a code snippet in the interpreter.
    Contains the output, execution time, and exception information.
    """

    term_out: list[str]
    exec_time: float
    exc_type: str | None
    exc_info: dict | None = None
    exc_stack: list[tuple] | None = None
```

- **Purpose**: Represents the outcome of executing a Python code snippet.
- **Fields**:
  - `term_out`: Captures the combined `stdout` and `stderr` outputs as a list of strings.
  - `exec_time`: Records the time taken to execute the code.
  - `exc_type`: Stores the type of exception encountered, if any.
  - `exc_info`: Contains additional exception information.
  - `exc_stack`: Holds the stack trace details as a list of tuples.

### Function: `exception_summary`

```python
def exception_summary(e, working_dir, exec_file_name, format_tb_ipython):
    """Generates a string that summarizes an exception and its stack trace (either in standard python repl or in IPython format)."""
    if format_tb_ipython:
        import IPython.core.ultratb

        # tb_offset = 1 to skip parts of the stack trace in weflow code
        tb = IPython.core.ultratb.VerboseTB(tb_offset=1, color_scheme="NoColor")
        tb_str = str(tb.text(*sys.exc_info()))
    else:
        tb_lines = traceback.format_exception(e)
        # skip parts of stack trace in weflow code
        tb_str = "".join(
            [
                line
                for line in tb_lines
                if "aide/" not in line and "importlib" not in line
            ]
        )
        # tb_str = "".join([l for l in tb_lines])

    # replace whole path to file with just filename (to remove agent workspace dir)
    tb_str = tb_str.replace(str(working_dir / exec_file_name), exec_file_name)

    exc_info = {}
    if hasattr(e, "args"):
        exc_info["args"] = [str(i) for i in e.args]
    for att in ["name", "msg", "obj"]:
        if hasattr(e, att):
            exc_info[att] = str(getattr(e, att))

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    exc_stack = [(t.filename, t.lineno, t.name, t.line) for t in tb]

    return tb_str, e.__class__.__name__, exc_info, exc_stack
```

- **Purpose**: Summarizes exceptions and their stack traces, formatting them either in standard Python or IPython style.
- **Parameters**:
  - `e`: The exception instance.
  - `working_dir`: The working directory where the code was executed.
  - `exec_file_name`: The name of the executed file.
  - `format_tb_ipython`: Boolean indicating whether to format the traceback using IPython.
- **Functionality**:
  - **IPython Formatting**: If `format_tb_ipython` is `True`, uses IPython's verbose traceback formatter.
  - **Standard Formatting**: Otherwise, formats the traceback, excluding lines related to AIDE's internal modules.
  - **Path Sanitization**: Replaces full file paths with just the filename to avoid exposing workspace directories.
  - **Exception Information**: Extracts and structures additional exception details.
  - **Stack Trace Extraction**: Compiles a list of stack trace tuples for further analysis.

### Class: `RedirectQueue`

```python
class RedirectQueue:
    def __init__(self, queue):
        self.queue = queue

    def write(self, msg):
        self.queue.put(msg)

    def flush(self):
        pass
```

- **Purpose**: Redirects `stdout` and `stderr` streams to a queue, enabling the main process to capture and process output from the child process.
- **Methods**:
  - `write(msg)`: Puts messages into the queue.
  - `flush()`: A placeholder method to comply with the file-like object interface.

### Class: `Interpreter`

The `Interpreter` class is the core of the `interpreter.py` module, responsible for executing Python code snippets in a controlled environment.

#### Initialization (`__init__`)

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    working_dir: Path | str,
    timeout: int = 3600,
    format_tb_ipython: bool = False,
    agent_file_name: str = "runfile.py",
):
    """
    Simulates a standalone Python REPL with an execution time limit.

    Args:
        working_dir (Path | str): working directory of the agent
        timeout (int, optional): Timeout for each code execution step. Defaults to 3600.
        format_tb_ipython (bool, optional): Whether to use IPython or default python REPL formatting for exceptions. Defaults to False.
        agent_file_name (str, optional): The name for the agent's code file. Defaults to "runfile.py".
    """
    # this really needs to be a path, otherwise causes issues that don't raise exc
    self.working_dir = Path(working_dir).resolve()
    assert (
        self.working_dir.exists()
    ), f"Working directory {self.working_dir} does not exist"
    self.timeout = timeout
    self.format_tb_ipython = format_tb_ipython
    self.agent_file_name = agent_file_name
    self.process: Process = None  # type: ignore
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `working_dir`: The directory where the agent operates. Must exist.
  - `timeout`: Maximum allowed time for code execution (in seconds).
  - `format_tb_ipython`: Determines the traceback format.
  - `agent_file_name`: Name of the file where the code will be written and executed.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Path Resolution**: Ensures `working_dir` is a valid path.
  - **Attribute Initialization**: Sets up instance variables for later use.
  - **Process Placeholder**: Initializes the `process` attribute to `None`.

#### Child Process Setup (`child_proc_setup`)

```python
def child_proc_setup(self, result_outq: Queue) -> None:
    # disable all warnings (before importing anything)
    import shutup

    shutup.mute_warnings()
    os.chdir(str(self.working_dir))

    # this seems to only  benecessary because we're exec'ing code from a string,
    # a .py file should be able to import modules from the cwd anyway
    sys.path.append(str(self.working_dir))

    # capture stdout and stderr
    # trunk-ignore(mypy/assignment)
    sys.stdout = sys.stderr = RedirectQueue(result_outq)
```

- **Purpose**: Configures the child process environment before executing code.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Warning Suppression**: Uses the `shutup` library to mute all warnings, ensuring cleaner output.
  - **Directory Change**: Sets the current working directory to `working_dir`.
  - **Path Adjustment**: Adds `working_dir` to `sys.path` to allow module imports.
  - **Output Redirection**: Redirects both `stdout` and `stderr` to the `result_outq` queue using the `RedirectQueue` class.

#### Running a Session (`_run_session`)

```python
def _run_session(
    self, code_inq: Queue, result_outq: Queue, event_outq: Queue
) -> None:
    self.child_proc_setup(result_outq)

    global_scope: dict = {}
    while True:
        code = code_inq.get()
        os.chdir(str(self.working_dir))
        with open(self.agent_file_name, "w") as f:
            f.write(code)

        event_outq.put(("state:ready",))
        try:
            exec(compile(code, self.agent_file_name, "exec"), global_scope)
        except BaseException as e:
            tb_str, e_cls_name, exc_info, exc_stack = exception_summary(
                e,
                self.working_dir,
                self.agent_file_name,
                self.format_tb_ipython,
            )
            result_outq.put(tb_str)
            if e_cls_name == "KeyboardInterrupt":
                e_cls_name = "TimeoutError"

            event_outq.put(("state:finished", e_cls_name, exc_info, exc_stack))
        else:
            event_outq.put(("state:finished", None, None, None))

        # remove the file after execution (otherwise it might be included in the data preview)
        os.remove(self.agent_file_name)

        # put EOF marker to indicate that we're done
        result_outq.put("<|EOF|>")
```

- **Purpose**: Executes code received from the `code_inq` queue and communicates the results back.
- **Parameters**:
  - `code_inq`: Queue from which to receive code snippets.
  - `result_outq`: Queue to which to send execution outputs.
  - `event_outq`: Queue to which to send event notifications (e.g., execution states).
- **Functionality**:
  1. **Setup**: Calls `child_proc_setup` to configure the environment.
  2. **Execution Loop**:
     - **Code Retrieval**: Waits for code to be available in `code_inq`.
     - **File Writing**: Writes the received code to `agent_file_name`.
     - **State Notification**: Signals readiness to execute.
     - **Code Execution**: Compiles and executes the code within a `global_scope` dictionary.
     - **Exception Handling**: If an exception occurs, summarizes it and sends details to `event_outq`.
     - **Cleanup**: Removes the executed file and sends an EOF marker to `result_outq`.
  3. **Continuous Operation**: The loop allows the child process to handle multiple code executions sequentially.

#### Process Management

##### Creating a Process (`create_process`)

```python
def create_process(self) -> None:
    # we use three queues to communicate with the child process:
    # - code_inq: send code to child to execute
    # - result_outq: receive stdout/stderr from child
    # - event_outq: receive events from child (e.g. state:ready, state:finished)
    # trunk-ignore(mypy/var-annotated)
    self.code_inq, self.result_outq, self.event_outq = Queue(), Queue(), Queue()
    self.process = Process(
        target=self._run_session,
        args=(self.code_inq, self.result_outq, self.event_outq),
    )
    self.process.start()
```

- **Purpose**: Initializes communication queues and starts the child process for code execution.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Queue Initialization**: Creates three separate queues for code input, result output, and event notifications.
  - **Process Creation**: Spawns a new `Process` targeting the `_run_session` method, passing the queues as arguments.
  - **Process Start**: Launches the child process, which begins waiting for code executions.

##### Cleaning Up a Session (`cleanup_session`)

```python
def cleanup_session(self):
    if self.process is None:
        return
    # give the child process a chance to terminate gracefully
    self.process.terminate()
    self.process.join(timeout=2)
    # kill the child process if it's still alive
    if self.process.exitcode is None:
        logger.warning("Child process failed to terminate gracefully, killing it..")
        self.process.kill()
        self.process.join()
    # don't wait for gc, clean up immediately
    self.process.close()
    self.process = None  # type: ignore
```

- **Purpose**: Safely terminates the child process, ensuring no orphaned processes remain.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Graceful Termination**: Attempts to terminate the child process gracefully using `terminate()`.
  - **Timeout Handling**: Waits for up to 2 seconds for the process to terminate.
  - **Forceful Killing**: If the process does not terminate within the timeout, forcefully kills it using `kill()`.
  - **Cleanup**: Closes the process handle and resets the `process` attribute to `None`.

#### Executing Code (`run`)

```python
def run(self, code: str, reset_session=True) -> ExecutionResult:
    """
    Execute the provided Python command in a separate process and return its output.

    Parameters:
        code (str): Python code to execute.
        reset_session (bool, optional): Whether to reset the interpreter session before executing the code. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        ExecutionResult: Object containing the output and metadata of the code execution.
    """

    logger.debug(f"REPL is executing code (reset_session={reset_session})")

    if reset_session:
        if self.process is not None:
            # terminate and clean up previous process
            self.cleanup_session()
        self.create_process()
    else:
        # reset_session needs to be True on first exec
        assert self.process is not None

    assert self.process.is_alive()

    self.code_inq.put(code)

    # wait for child to actually start execution (we don't want interrupt child setup)
    try:
        state = self.event_outq.get(timeout=10)
    except queue.Empty:
        msg = "REPL child process failed to start execution"
        logger.critical(msg)
        while not self.result_outq.empty():
            logger.error(f"REPL output queue dump: {self.result_outq.get()}")
        raise RuntimeError(msg) from None
    assert state[0] == "state:ready", state
    start_time = time.time()

    # this flag indicates that the child has exceeded the time limit and an interrupt was sent
    # if the child process dies without this flag being set, it's an unexpected termination
    child_in_overtime = False

    while True:
        try:
            # check if the child is done
            state = self.event_outq.get(timeout=1)  # wait for state:finished
            assert state[0] == "state:finished", state
            exec_time = time.time() - start_time
            break
        except queue.Empty:
            # we haven't heard back from the child -> check if it's still alive (assuming overtime interrupt wasn't sent yet)
            if not child_in_overtime and not self.process.is_alive():
                msg = "REPL child process died unexpectedly"
                logger.critical(msg)
                while not self.result_outq.empty():
                    logger.error(
                        f"REPL output queue dump: {self.result_outq.get()}"
                    )
                raise RuntimeError(msg) from None

            # child is alive and still executing -> check if we should sigint..
            if self.timeout is None:
                continue
            running_time = time.time() - start_time
            if running_time > self.timeout:

                # [TODO] handle this in a better way
                assert reset_session, "Timeout occurred in interactive session"

                # send interrupt to child
                os.kill(self.process.pid, signal.SIGINT)  # type: ignore
                child_in_overtime = True
                # terminate if we're overtime by more than a minute
                if running_time > self.timeout + 60:
                    logger.warning("Child failed to terminate, killing it..")
                    self.cleanup_session()

                    state = (None, "TimeoutError", {}, [])
                    exec_time = self.timeout
                    break

    output: list[str] = []
    # read all stdout/stderr from child up to the EOF marker
    # waiting until the queue is empty is not enough since
    # the feeder thread in child might still be adding to the queue
    while not self.result_outq.empty() or not output or output[-1] != "<|EOF|>":
        output.append(self.result_outq.get())
    output.pop()  # remove the EOF marker

    e_cls_name, exc_info, exc_stack = state[1:]

    if e_cls_name == "TimeoutError":
        output.append(
            f"TimeoutError: Execution exceeded the time limit of {humanize.naturaldelta(self.timeout)}"
        )
    else:
        output.append(
            f"Execution time: {humanize.naturaldelta(exec_time)} seconds (time limit is {humanize.naturaldelta(self.timeout)})."
        )
    return ExecutionResult(output, exec_time, e_cls_name, exc_info, exc_stack)
```

- **Purpose**: Executes a given Python code snippet, managing the execution lifecycle, enforcing timeouts, and capturing results.
- **Parameters**:
  - `code`: The Python code to execute.
  - `reset_session`: Determines whether to reset the interpreter session before execution. Defaults to `True`.
- **Functionality**:
  1. **Session Management**:
     - **Resetting Session**: If `reset_session` is `True`, cleans up any existing child process and creates a new one.
     - **Session Validation**: Ensures that a child process is running and alive.
  2. **Code Execution**:
     - **Sending Code**: Puts the code into `code_inq` for the child process to execute.
     - **State Monitoring**: Waits for the child process to signal readiness (`state:ready`).
  3. **Timeout Handling**:
     - **Execution Time Tracking**: Records the start time to monitor execution duration.
     - **State Loop**: Continuously checks for `state:finished` within the timeout period.
     - **Interrupting Execution**: Sends a `SIGINT` signal if execution exceeds the timeout.
     - **Forceful Termination**: Kills the child process if it does not terminate within an additional minute after the timeout.
  4. **Output Collection**:
     - **Reading Output**: Collects all messages from `result_outq` until the EOF marker (`<|EOF|>`) is encountered.
     - **Exception Handling**: Appends a timeout error message if applicable or records the execution time.
  5. **Result Packaging**: Returns an `ExecutionResult` instance containing all relevant execution details.

## Example Usage

To illustrate how the `Interpreter` class operates within the AIDE framework, let's walk through a practical example. This example demonstrates executing a simple Python script that calculates the sum of numbers and handles potential errors.

### Scenario: Calculating the Sum of Numbers

1. **Setup**

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    from interpreter import Interpreter, ExecutionResult

    # Define the working directory
    working_directory = Path("/path/to/working_dir")

    # Initialize the interpreter with a 10-second timeout
    interpreter = Interpreter(
        working_dir=working_directory,
        timeout=10,
        format_tb_ipython=False,
        agent_file_name="sum_script.py"
    )
    ```

    - **Working Directory**: Ensure that `/path/to/working_dir` exists and is accessible.
    - **Timeout**: Sets a 10-second execution limit to prevent long-running scripts.

2. **Executing a Valid Script**

    ```python
    valid_code = """
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    total = sum(numbers)
    print(f"The sum is {total}")
    """

    result: ExecutionResult = interpreter.run(valid_code)

    print("Output:")
    for line in result.term_out:
        print(line)
    print(f"Execution Time: {result.exec_time} seconds")
    ```

    **Expected Output**:

    ```plaintext
    Output:
    The sum is 15
    Execution time: 0 seconds (time limit is 10 seconds).
    Execution Time: 0.1 seconds
    ```

    - **Explanation**: The script calculates the sum of numbers and prints the result. The interpreter captures the output and execution time without any exceptions.

3. **Executing a Script with an Error**

    ```python
    error_code = """
    numbers = [1, 2, 3]
    total = sum(numbers)
    print(f"The sum is {total}")
    print(unknown_variable)  # This will raise a NameError
    """

    result: ExecutionResult = interpreter.run(error_code)

    print("Output:")
    for line in result.term_out:
        print(line)
    print(f"Execution Time: {result.exec_time} seconds")
    print(f"Exception Type: {result.exc_type}")
    ```

    **Expected Output**:

    ```plaintext
    Output:
    The sum is 6
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "sum_script.py", line 5, in <module>
        print(unknown_variable)  # This will raise a NameError
    NameError: name 'unknown_variable' is not defined
    Execution time: 0 seconds (time limit is 10 seconds).
    Execution Time: 0.1 seconds
    Exception Type: NameError
    ```

    - **Explanation**: The script attempts to print an undefined variable, resulting in a `NameError`. The interpreter captures the exception details along with the execution output.

4. **Executing a Long-Running Script (Timeout Example)**

    ```python
    long_running_code = """
    import time
    time.sleep(15)  # Sleep for 15 seconds, exceeding the 10-second timeout
    print("Completed long-running task.")
    """

    result: ExecutionResult = interpreter.run(long_running_code)

    print("Output:")
    for line in result.term_out:
        print(line)
    print(f"Execution Time: {result.exec_time} seconds")
    print(f"Exception Type: {result.exc_type}")
    ```

    **Expected Output**:

    ```plaintext
    Output:
    TimeoutError: Execution exceeded the time limit of 10 seconds
    Execution Time: 10 seconds
    Exception Type: TimeoutError
    ```

    - **Explanation**: The script sleeps for 15 seconds, which exceeds the 10-second timeout. The interpreter terminates the execution and reports a `TimeoutError`.

## Best Practices and Key Takeaways

When utilizing the `Interpreter` class within the AIDE framework, adhering to best practices ensures optimal performance and reliability.

1. **Proper Working Directory Setup**:
    - Ensure that the specified `working_dir` exists and contains all necessary modules and data files required by the code snippets to be executed.
    - Example:
      ```python
      working_directory = Path("/path/to/working_dir")
      interpreter = Interpreter(working_dir=working_directory)
      ```

2. **Handling Timeouts Gracefully**:
    - Set appropriate `timeout` values based on the expected execution time of your scripts.
    - Implement logic to handle `TimeoutError` exceptions, possibly retrying or adjusting the code.
    - Example:
      ```python
      try:
          result = interpreter.run(long_running_code)
      except RuntimeError as e:
          print("Execution timed out.")
      ```

3. **Managing Child Processes**:
    - Always ensure that child processes are cleaned up to prevent resource leaks.
    - Use the `cleanup_session` method when necessary, especially before shutting down the main application.
    - Example:
      ```python
      interpreter.cleanup_session()
      ```

4. **Secure Code Execution**:
    - Be cautious when executing untrusted code. Although isolation helps, always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent potential security risks.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
    - Utilize the logging capabilities to monitor execution flows, debug issues, and track performance metrics.
    - Example:
      ```python
      logger = logging.getLogger("aide")
      logger.debug("Executing code snippet.")
      ```

6. **Exception Handling**:
    - Leverage the structured exception summaries to programmatically handle different error types, enhancing the robustness of your AI workflows.
    - Example:
      ```python
      if result.exc_type:
          handle_exception(result.exc_type, result.exc_info)
      ```
