---

## Detailed Explanation

To fully comprehend the functionalities offered by `backend_openai.py`, it's essential to dissect its components and understand how they interact to facilitate seamless communication with OpenAI's API.

### Imports and Dependencies

```python
"""Backend for OpenAI API."""

import json
import logging
import time

from .utils import FunctionSpec, OutputType, opt_messages_to_list, backoff_create
from funcy import notnone, once, select_values
import openai
```

- **Standard Libraries**:
  - `json`: For handling JSON data, especially when dealing with function call arguments.
  - `logging`: Facilitates logging of events, errors, and debug information.
  - `time`: Utilized for tracking request durations and implementing retry mechanisms.

- **AIDE Modules**:
  - `.utils`: Contains utility functions and classes used across the AIDE framework.
    - `FunctionSpec`: Defines specifications for function calling.
    - `OutputType`: Type alias for function outputs.
    - `opt_messages_to_list`: Converts optional messages into a list format.
    - `backoff_create`: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff.

- **Third-Party Libraries**:
  - `funcy`:
    - `notnone`: Filters out `None` values.
    - `once`: Decorator to ensure a function is executed only once.
    - `select_values`: Selects specific values from a dictionary based on provided criteria.
  - `openai`: Official Python client for OpenAI's API, facilitating interactions with their language models.

- **Logger Initialization**:
  - Initializes a logger named "aide" to capture and log relevant information throughout the execution.

### Global Variables and Constants

```python
_client: openai.OpenAI = None  # type: ignore

OPENAI_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS = (
    openai.RateLimitError,
    openai.APIConnectionError,
    openai.APITimeoutError,
    openai.InternalServerError,
)
```

- **`_client`**: A global variable to hold the OpenAI API client instance. It's initialized as `None` and set up once using the `_setup_openai_client` function.

- **`OPENAI_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS`**: A tuple of exception classes that represent timeout and connection-related errors specific to OpenAI's API. These exceptions trigger the retry mechanism to ensure robust communication.

### Function: `_setup_openai_client`

```python
@once
def _setup_openai_client():
    global _client
    _client = openai.OpenAI(max_retries=0)
```

- **Purpose**: Initializes the OpenAI API client. The `@once` decorator from `funcy` ensures that this setup occurs only once, regardless of how many times the function is called.

- **Functionality**:
  - **Global Access**: Declares `_client` as a global variable to be accessible throughout the module.
  - **Client Initialization**: Creates an instance of `openai.OpenAI` with `max_retries` set to `0`, meaning it won't retry failed requests by default. However, the `backoff_create` utility later handles retries.

- **Usage**: Called within the `query` function to ensure the client is set up before making API requests.

### Function: `query`

```python
def query(
    system_message: str | None,
    user_message: str | None,
    func_spec: FunctionSpec | None = None,
    **model_kwargs,
) -> tuple[OutputType, float, int, int, dict]:
    _setup_openai_client()
    filtered_kwargs: dict = select_values(notnone, model_kwargs)  # type: ignore

    messages = opt_messages_to_list(system_message, user_message)

    if func_spec is not None:
        filtered_kwargs["tools"] = [func_spec.as_openai_tool_dict]
        # force the model the use the function
        filtered_kwargs["tool_choice"] = func_spec.openai_tool_choice_dict

    t0 = time.time()
    completion = backoff_create(
        _client.chat.completions.create,
        OPENAI_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS,
        messages=messages,
        **filtered_kwargs,
    )
    req_time = time.time() - t0

    choice = completion.choices[0]

    if func_spec is None:
        output = choice.message.content
    else:
        assert (
            choice.message.tool_calls
        ), f"function_call is empty, it is not a function call: {choice.message}"
        assert (
            choice.message.tool_calls[0].function.name == func_spec.name
        ), "Function name mismatch"
        try:
            output = json.loads(choice.message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            logger.error(
                f"Error decoding the function arguments: {choice.message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments}"
            )
            raise e

    in_tokens = completion.usage.prompt_tokens
    out_tokens = completion.usage.completion_tokens

    info = {
        "system_fingerprint": completion.system_fingerprint,
        "model": completion.model,
        "created": completion.created,
    }

    return output, req_time, in_tokens, out_tokens, info
```

- **Functionality**:
  1. **Client Setup**: Ensures that the OpenAI API client is initialized by calling `_setup_openai_client()`.
  
  2. **Keyword Arguments Filtering**:
     - Utilizes `select_values(notnone, model_kwargs)` to filter out any `None` values from `model_kwargs`.
  
  3. **Message Handling**:
     - Converts the `system_message` and `user_message` into a list format using `opt_messages_to_list`.
  
  4. **Function Calling Support**:
     - If `func_spec` is provided, it adds the function specifications to the `filtered_kwargs` under the `tools` key and sets the `tool_choice` to force the model to use the specified function.
  
  5. **API Request Execution**:
     - Records the start time using `time.time()`.
     - Sends the request to OpenAI's API using `_client.chat.completions.create` wrapped with `backoff_create` to handle retries for specified exceptions.
     - Calculates the request duration (`req_time`).
  
  6. **Response Handling**:
     - Extracts the first choice from the completion.
     - If `func_spec` is not provided, retrieves the generated text content.
     - If `func_spec` is provided, it ensures that the model made a function call, validates the function name, and parses the function arguments from JSON.
  
  7. **Token Usage**:
     - Extracts the number of input and output tokens used in the request.
  
  8. **Additional Information**:
     - Compiles additional metadata such as `system_fingerprint`, `model`, and `created` timestamp.
  
  9. **Return**: Provides the generated output and associated metadata as a tuple.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Utilizes `backoff_create` to implement retry logic for transient errors defined in `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS`.
  - Asserts that function calls are properly made and that the function names match the specifications.
  - Logs and raises errors if JSON decoding of function arguments fails.

## Example Usage

To illustrate how the `backend_openai.py` module operates within the AIDE framework, let's walk through a practical example. This example demonstrates sending a prompt to OpenAI's language model to generate a technical summary and handling function calls.

### Scenario: Generating a Technical Summary

Imagine you're developing an AI assistant that generates technical summaries based on research journals. You want to use OpenAI's language model to process the journal content and produce concise summaries. Additionally, you want the model to perform specific functions, such as extracting key metrics from the summaries.

### Sample Code

```python
from aide.backend_openai import query
from aide.utils import FunctionSpec

# Define system and user messages
system_message = "You are a knowledgeable research assistant."
user_message = "Summarize the following research findings on machine learning optimization techniques."

# Define a function specification (assuming FunctionSpec is properly defined)
function_spec = FunctionSpec(
    name="extract_metrics",
    description="Extract key performance metrics from the summary.",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "accuracy": {"type": "number"},
            "precision": {"type": "number"},
            "recall": {"type": "number"}
        },
        "required": ["accuracy", "precision", "recall"]
    }
)

# Define additional model parameters
model_kwargs = {
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "max_tokens": 500,
}

# Send query to OpenAI's API with function call
output, req_time, in_tokens, out_tokens, info = query(
    system_message=system_message,
    user_message=user_message,
    func_spec=function_spec,
    **model_kwargs,
)

# Display the results
print("Generated Summary:")
print(output)
print("\nRequest Time:", req_time, "seconds")
print("Input Tokens:", in_tokens)
print("Output Tokens:", out_tokens)
print("Additional Info:", info)
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Generated Summary:
{
    "accuracy": 0.85,
    "precision": 0.80,
    "recall": 0.75
}

Request Time: 3.42 seconds
Input Tokens: 45
Output Tokens: 30
Additional Info: {'system_fingerprint': 'abc123', 'model': 'gpt-4', 'created': 1617181920}
