### Imports and Dependencies

```python
import time

from .utils import FunctionSpec, OutputType, opt_messages_to_list, backoff_create
from funcy import notnone, once, select_values
import anthropic
```

- **Standard Libraries**:
  - `time`: Utilized for tracking request durations and implementing retry mechanisms.

- **AIDE Modules**:
  - `.utils`: Contains utility functions and classes used across the AIDE framework.
    - `FunctionSpec`: Defines specifications for function calling (not implemented for Anthropic).
    - `OutputType`: Type alias for function outputs.
    - `opt_messages_to_list`: Converts optional messages into a list format.
    - `backoff_create`: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff.

- **Third-Party Libraries**:
  - `funcy`:
    - `notnone`: Filters out `None` values.
    - `once`: Decorator to ensure a function is executed only once.
    - `select_values`: Selects specific values from a dictionary based on provided criteria.
  - `anthropic`: Official Python client for Anthropic's API, facilitating interactions with their language models.

### Global Variables and Constants

```python
_client: anthropic.Anthropic = None  # type: ignore

ANTHROPIC_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS = (
    anthropic.RateLimitError,
    anthropic.APIConnectionError,
    anthropic.APITimeoutError,
    anthropic.InternalServerError,
)
```

- **`_client`**: A global variable to hold the Anthropic API client instance. It's initialized as `None` and set up once using the `_setup_anthropic_client` function.

- **`ANTHROPIC_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS`**: A tuple of exception classes that represent timeout and connection-related errors specific to Anthropic's API. These exceptions trigger the retry mechanism to ensure robust communication.

### Function: `_setup_anthropic_client`

```python
@once
def _setup_anthropic_client():
    global _client
    _client = anthropic.Anthropic(max_retries=0)
```

- **Purpose**: Initializes the Anthropic API client. The `@once` decorator from `funcy` ensures that this setup occurs only once, regardless of how many times the function is called.

- **Functionality**:
  - **Global Access**: Declares `_client` as a global variable to be accessible throughout the module.
  - **Client Initialization**: Creates an instance of `anthropic.Anthropic` with `max_retries` set to `0`, meaning it won't retry failed requests by default. However, the `backoff_create` utility later handles retries.

- **Usage**: Called within the `query` function to ensure the client is set up before making API requests.

### Function: `query`

```python
def query(
    system_message: str | None,
    user_message: str | None,
    func_spec: FunctionSpec | None = None,
    **model_kwargs,
) -> tuple[OutputType, float, int, int, dict]:
    _setup_anthropic_client()

    filtered_kwargs: dict = select_values(notnone, model_kwargs)  # type: ignore
    if "max_tokens" not in filtered_kwargs:
        filtered_kwargs["max_tokens"] = 4096  # default for Claude models

    if func_spec is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "Anthropic does not support function calling for now."
        )

    # Anthropic doesn't allow not having a user messages
    # if we only have system msg -> use it as user msg
    if system_message is not None and user_message is None:
        system_message, user_message = user_message, system_message

    # Anthropic passes the system messages as a separate argument
    if system_message is not None:
        filtered_kwargs["system"] = system_message

    messages = opt_messages_to_list(None, user_message)

    t0 = time.time()
    message = backoff_create(
        _client.messages.create,
        ANTHROPIC_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS,
        messages=messages,
        **filtered_kwargs,
    )
    req_time = time.time() - t0

    assert len(message.content) == 1 and message.content[0].type == "text"

    output: str = message.content[0].text
    in_tokens = message.usage.input_tokens
    out_tokens = message.usage.output_tokens

    info = {
        "stop_reason": message.stop_reason,
    }

    return output, req_time, in_tokens, out_tokens, info
```

- **Purpose**: Sends a query to Anthropic's language model API and retrieves the generated response along with relevant metadata.

- **Parameters**:
  - `system_message` (`str | None`): A system-level prompt that sets the context or behavior for the language model.
  - `user_message` (`str | None`): The user-level prompt or input for the language model.
  - `func_spec` (`FunctionSpec | None`): Specifications for function calling. Not supported by Anthropic's API; raises `NotImplementedError` if provided.
  - `**model_kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments to customize the API request, such as `temperature`, `top_p`, etc.

- **Return Type**: A tuple containing:
  - `output` (`OutputType`): The generated text from the language model.
  - `req_time` (`float`): The time taken to process the request.
  - `in_tokens` (`int`): The number of input tokens consumed.
  - `out_tokens` (`int`): The number of output tokens generated.
  - `info` (`dict`): Additional information, such as the reason for stopping.

- **Functionality**:
  1. **Client Setup**: Ensures that the Anthropic API client is initialized by calling `_setup_anthropic_client()`.
  
  2. **Keyword Arguments Filtering**:
     - Utilizes `select_values(notnone, model_kwargs)` to filter out any `None` values from `model_kwargs`.
     - Sets a default `max_tokens` value of `4096` if not provided, aligning with Anthropic's Claude models.
  
  3. **Function Calling Support**:
     - Raises `NotImplementedError` if `func_spec` is provided, as Anthropic's API currently doesn't support function calling.
  
  4. **Message Handling**:
     - Anthropic requires at least a user message. If only a system message is provided, it's reassigned as the user message.
     - Adds the system message to `filtered_kwargs` under the `system` key.
     - Converts the user message into a list format using `opt_messages_to_list`.
  
  5. **API Request Execution**:
     - Records the start time using `time.time()`.
     - Sends the request to Anthropic's API using `_client.messages.create` wrapped with `backoff_create` to handle retries for specified exceptions.
     - Calculates the request duration (`req_time`).
  
  6. **Response Handling**:
     - Ensures that the response contains exactly one text message.
     - Extracts the generated text, input tokens, and output tokens.
     - Compiles additional information, such as the reason for stopping.
  
  7. **Return**: Provides the generated output and associated metadata as a tuple.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Utilizes `backoff_create` to implement retry logic for transient errors defined in `ANTHROPIC_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTIONS`.
  - Asserts that the response contains exactly one text message to maintain consistency.
