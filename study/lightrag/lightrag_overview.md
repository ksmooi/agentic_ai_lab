Allows inserting documents with custom-defined chunks, providing greater control over how documents are segmented and stored.

```python
# Custom chunks
full_text = "Complete document content."
text_chunks = [
    "First chunk of the document.",
    "Second chunk of the document."
]

# Synchronous insertion
lightrag.insert_custom_chunks(full_text, text_chunks)

# Asynchronous insertion
async def add_custom_chunks():
    await lightrag.ainsert_custom_chunks(full_text, text_chunks)

asyncio.run(add_custom_chunks())
```

#### `insert_custom_kg`

Enables the insertion of custom knowledge graphs, allowing users to define entities, relationships, and their interconnections explicitly.

```python
