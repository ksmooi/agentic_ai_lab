## Introduction

In web development, understanding how to work with HTTP requests and responses is essential. FastAPI simplifies these operations by providing high-level abstractions:

- The **Request** object allows you to inspect incoming HTTP requests in detail.
- The **Response** object gives you full control over what is sent back to the client.

In this article, we will explore various ways to interact with the `Request` object in FastAPI. We will cover everything from reading headers and query parameters to handling file uploads and form data. By the end of this article, you should have a good understanding of how to access different parts of an HTTP request and how to use this information to build efficient APIs.

## The Request Object in FastAPI

The `Request` object in FastAPI (imported from `fastapi`) provides access to:

- **Headers:** Retrieve HTTP headers.
- **Query Parameters:** Access parameters appended to the URL.
- **Body:** Read raw data or JSON payload.
- **Path Parameters:** Get values from the URL path.
- **Client Info:** Discover details like the client's IP.
- **Cookies:** Read cookies sent with the request.
- **Form Data & Files:** Process form submissions and file uploads.
- **HTTP Method:** Determine the request method (GET, POST, etc.).

The table below summarizes some common properties:

| **Property**            | **Usage**                                      | **Example**                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `request.headers`       | Access HTTP headers                            | Return all headers as a dictionary             |
| `request.path_params`   | Get parameters from the URL path               | Access named parameters                        |
| `request.query_params`  | Access URL query parameters                    | Return query parameters as a dictionary        |
| `request.body()`        | Read the raw request body (bytes)              | Await and decode bytes                         |
| `request.json()`        | Parse and return JSON from request body        | Await JSON data                                |
| `request.form()`        | Access form data from a POST request           | Await form data as a form dictionary           |
| `request.client`        | Get client information (e.g., IP address)      | Return client's host info                      |
| `request.cookies`       | Access cookies sent by the client              | Return cookies as a dictionary                 |
| `request.method`        | Retrieve the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)     | Return the request method as string            |

Below are several examples demonstrating how to use the `Request` object.

## Request Examples

### Example 1: Accessing Headers  
This endpoint reads the incoming HTTP headers and returns them as a dictionary.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/headers")
async def read_headers(request: Request):
    headers = request.headers
    return {"headers": dict(headers)}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "headers": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1:8000",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*",
    ...
  }
}
```

---

### Example 2: Accessing Query Parameters  
This endpoint accesses query parameters from the URL and returns them as a dictionary.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/query")
async def read_query_params(request: Request):
    query_params = request.query_params
    return {"query_params": dict(query_params)}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "query_params": {
    "name": "fastapi",
    "page": "1"
  }
}
```

---

### Example 3: Accessing the Request Body  
This endpoint reads the raw request body (as bytes), decodes it to a string, and returns it.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/body")
async def read_body(request: Request):
    body = await request.body()
    return {"body": body.decode("utf-8")}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "body": "This is the raw body content"
}
```

---

### Example 4: Accessing JSON Body  
This endpoint parses the request body as JSON and returns the resulting data.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/json")
async def read_json(request: Request):
    json_data = await request.json()
    return {"json_data": json_data}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "json_data": {
    "key": "value",
    "number": 123
  }
}
```

---

### Example 5: Accessing Path Parameters  
This endpoint demonstrates how to access path parameters both via the function signature and via `request.path_params`.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, request: Request):
    path_params = request.path_params
    return {"item_id": item_id, "path_params": path_params}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "item_id": 42,
  "path_params": {"item_id": "42"}
}
```

---

### Example 6: Accessing Client Information  
This endpoint returns the client’s IP address extracted from the request.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/client")
async def read_client_info(request: Request):
    client_host = request.client.host
    return {"client_host": client_host}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "client_host": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

---

### Example 7: Accessing Cookies  
This endpoint reads cookies sent with the request and returns them.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/cookies")
async def read_cookies(request: Request):
    cookies = request.cookies
    return {"cookies": cookies}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "cookies": {
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "theme": "dark"
  }
}
```

---

### Example 8: Accessing Form Data  
For form submissions, `request.form()` asynchronously returns the form data as a multidict, which is then converted to a dictionary.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/form")
async def read_form_data(request: Request):
    form_data = await request.form()
    return {"form_data": dict(form_data)}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "form_data": {
    "username": "john",
    "password": "secret"
  }
}
```

---

### Example 9: Accessing Files  
This endpoint demonstrates handling file uploads by accessing files from the form data.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(request: Request):
    form_data = await request.form()
    files = form_data.getlist("file")
    return {"filenames": [file.filename for file in files]}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "filenames": ["image1.png", "document.pdf"]
}
```

---

### Example 10: Accessing the Request Method  
This endpoint returns the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) used in the request.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.api_route("/method", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def read_method(request: Request):
    method = request.method
    return {"method": method}
```

**Output:**
```
{
  "method": "GET"
}
```

- **Request Bodies:** In both raw and JSON formats.
- **Path Parameters:** To capture dynamic URL segments.
- **Client Information:** Such as the client's IP address.
- **Cookies:** For managing session data.
- **Form Data and Files:** For processing file uploads and form submissions.
- **HTTP Methods:** To dynamically handle various request types.

Understanding these features is crucial for developing robust APIs and web applications with FastAPI. By mastering the use of the `Request` object, you can build applications that are both responsive and flexible, capable of handling a variety of client inputs and interactions.
