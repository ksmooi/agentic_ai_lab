## Overview

When building web applications and APIs, handling file uploads is a common requirement. FastAPI simplifies this by providing the `UploadFile` class, which offers asynchronous file operations and integrates smoothly with FastAPI’s dependency injection system.

## What is `fastapi.UploadFile`?

`fastapi.UploadFile` is a class used in FastAPI to handle file uploads. It abstracts file handling by allowing you to work with file metadata (such as the filename and headers) and supports asynchronous operations for reading, writing, seeking, and closing files. This makes it ideal for processing user-uploaded files without blocking the server.

You can import it directly from FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import UploadFile
```

## Attributes and Methods

Below is a table summarizing the key attributes and methods of the `UploadFile` class:

| **Attribute / Method** | **Description**                                                                                     | **Type / Parameter**    | **Default** |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| `file`                 | The underlying standard Python file object (blocking, non-async).                                    | `BinaryIO`              | -           |
| `filename`             | The original name of the uploaded file.                                                            | `str` or `None`         | `None`      |
| `size`                 | The size of the file in bytes.                                                                      | `int` or `None`         | `None`      |
| `headers`              | The headers from the file upload request.                                                         | `Headers` or `None`     | `None`      |
| `content_type`         | The content type of the uploaded file, derived from the headers.                                    | `str`                   | -           |
| `read(size=-1)`        | Asynchronously reads bytes from the file. `size` specifies the number of bytes to read.             | `int` (default: `-1`)   | `-1`        |
| `write(data)`          | Asynchronously writes bytes to the file. Useful for writing to file-like objects.                   | `bytes`                 | -           |
| `seek(offset)`         | Asynchronously moves to a specified byte position in the file.                                      | `int`                   | -           |
| `close()`              | Asynchronously closes the file. This is important for resource cleanup.                             | -                       | -           |

## Basic Usage Example

Let’s start with a simple example that demonstrates how to receive a file upload using `fastapi.UploadFile`.

### Server-side Code

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/uploadfile/")
async def create_upload_file(file: UploadFile):
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```

This endpoint accepts a file upload and returns the original filename.

### Client-side Example (Python)

Below is an example client using the `requests` library to send a file to the endpoint:

```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploadfile/"
files = {'file': open('example.txt', 'rb')}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)
print(response.json())
```

When you run the server and execute the client code, you should see a JSON response with the filename.


## Error Handling Example

Handling errors is crucial when working with file uploads. In the example below, we add error handling to ensure that only text files (`.txt`) are accepted, and we manage potential issues during file processing.

### Server-side Code with Error Handling

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, HTTPException
import os

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/uploadfile-error/")
async def create_upload_file_error(file: UploadFile):
    # Check file extension for allowed types
    if not file.filename.endswith('.txt'):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Only .txt files are allowed.")
    
    try:
        # Read file contents asynchronously
        contents = await file.read()
        # Simulate processing the file (e.g., saving it or further parsing)
        if len(contents) == 0:
            raise ValueError("Uploaded file is empty.")
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        # Ensure the file is properly closed
        await file.close()
    
    return {"filename": file.filename, "size": len(contents)}
```

### Client-side Example (Python) for Error Handling

```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploadfile-error/"
# Change the filename to a non-txt file to see error handling in action
files = {'file': open('example.txt', 'rb')}

response = requests.post(url, files=files)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Upload successful:", response.json())
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.json())
```

This example demonstrates:
- **File type validation:** Only `.txt` files are processed.
- **Exception handling:** Any errors during file reading are caught and returned as HTTP errors.
- **Resource cleanup:** The file is closed regardless of whether an error occurs.
