## Introduction

Security is a cornerstone of modern web applications. Whether you’re protecting sensitive data or ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints, integrating security into your application is essential. FastAPI simplifies this process with its built-in security utilities. Among these, `fastapi.Security` stands out as a specialized tool designed to handle security requirements such as authentication and authorization while integrating seamlessly with the automatic API documentation generation.

In this guide, we will explore the features and benefits of `fastapi.Security` and illustrate how to implement various security measures using multiple examples. Each example is accompanied by HTTP request and response samples to show how the security component retrieves key information.

---

## What is `fastapi.Security`?

`fastapi.Security` is a dependency injection tool specifically tailored for security concerns in FastAPI applications. While it works similarly to the more general `fastapi.Depends`, it offers additional features for security-related dependencies, such as:

- **Automatic OpenAPI Documentation:** Security schemes declared with `Security` are automatically included in the OpenAPI schema.
- **Scope Support:** When working with OAuth2, you can define and validate scopes.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Clearly indicates that a dependency is intended for authentication or authorization purposes.

By using `fastapi.Security`, you can build secure endpoints in a modular, maintainable, and well-documented way.

---

## How Does `fastapi.Security` Work?

When you declare a dependency using `Security`, FastAPI:

1. **Identifies the Dependency:** Recognizes that the parameter is a security dependency.
2. **Executes the Dependency Function:** Calls the provided function (e.g., for token validation, API key checking).
3. **Injects the Result:** Passes the validated or transformed result into your endpoint function.
4. **Integrates with Documentation:** Automatically adds the associated security scheme details to the OpenAPI docs.

This process not only centralizes your security logic but also makes it easier to test and maintain.

---

## Examples of Using `fastapi.Security`

Below are several examples demonstrating how you can leverage `fastapi.Security` to implement different security strategies along with sample HTTP requests and responses.

### Example 1: API Key Authentication

In this example, we create an API key dependency that validates a custom header.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security.api_key import APIKeyHeader

app = FastAPI()

# Define an APIKeyHeader dependency
api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-Key", auto_error=True)

def get_api_key(api_key: str = Security(api_key_header)):
    if api_key != "secret-key":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Could not validate API key",
        )
    return api_key

@app.get("/secure-data")
def secure_data(api_key: str = Security(get_api_key)):
    return {"message": "Access granted", "api_key": api_key}
```

#### HTTP Request & Response Examples

**Successful Request (Valid API Key):**

_Request:_

```http
GET /secure-data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-API-Key: secret-key
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"message": "Access granted", "api_key": "secret-key"}
```

**Failed Request (Invalid API Key):**

_Request:_

```http
GET /secure-data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-API-Key: wrong-key
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json

{"detail": "Could not validate API key"}
```

---

### Example 2: OAuth2 with Password Bearer

This example demonstrates how to use OAuth2 for authentication using the password bearer token scheme.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security, HTTPException, status, Depends
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm

app = FastAPI()

# Create an OAuth2 scheme dependency
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

def get_current_user(token: str = Security(oauth2_scheme)):
    if token != "fake-token":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return {"username": "john.doe"}

@app.post("/token")
def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    # In a real application, authenticate the user and generate a token.
    return {"access_token": "fake-token", "token_type": "bearer"}

@app.get("/users/me")
def read_users_me(current_user: dict = Security(get_current_user)):
    return current_user
```

#### HTTP Request & Response Examples

**Requesting a Token:**

_Request:_

```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=john.doe&password=secret
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"access_token": "fake-token", "token_type": "bearer"}
```

**Successful Request to Secured Endpoint:**

_Request:_

```http
GET /users/me HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer fake-token
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "john.doe"}
```

**Failed Request (Invalid Token):**

_Request:_

```http
GET /users/me HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer invalid-token
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json

{"detail": "Invalid authentication credentials"}
```

### Example 3: OAuth2 with Scopes

This example extends OAuth2 to support scope-based authorization.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, SecurityScopes
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

# Define OAuth2 with scopes
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(
    tokenUrl="token",
    scopes={"me": "Read information about the current user", "items": "Access items"}
)

def get_current_user(security_scopes: SecurityScopes, token: str = Security(oauth2_scheme)):
    if token != "fake-token":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid token",
        )
    
    # In a real app, decode the token and retrieve the scopes.
    token_scopes = ["me"]  # Example: token contains only "me" scope
    
    for scope in security_scopes.scopes:
        if scope not in token_scopes:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
                detail="Not enough permissions",
            )
    
    return {"username": "john.doe", "scopes": token_scopes}

@app.get("/users/me")
def read_users_me(current_user: dict = Security(get_current_user, scopes=["me"])):
    return current_user

@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(current_user: dict = Security(get_current_user, scopes=["items"])):
    return {"item": "Secure item", "user": current_user}
```

#### HTTP Request & Response Examples

**Request to `/users/me` (Scope: `me`):**

_Request:_

```http
GET /users/me HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer fake-token
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "john.doe", "scopes": ["me"]}
```

**Request to `/items/` (Scope: `items` but token only has `me`):**

_Request:_

```http
GET /items/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer fake-token
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json

{"detail": "Not enough permissions"}
```

**Request with an Invalid Token:**

_Request:_

```http
GET /users/me HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer invalid-token
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json

{"detail": "Invalid token"}
```

---

### Example 4: HTTP Basic Authentication

This example illustrates how to implement HTTP Basic Authentication using `fastapi.Security`.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import HTTPBasic, HTTPBasicCredentials
import secrets

app = FastAPI()
security = HTTPBasic()

def get_current_username(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Security(security)):
    correct_username = secrets.compare_digest(credentials.username, "admin")
    correct_password = secrets.compare_digest(credentials.password, "secret")
    if not (correct_username and correct_password):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Incorrect username or password",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"},
        )
    return credentials.username

@app.get("/basic-auth")
def basic_auth(username: str = Security(get_current_username)):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {username}"}
```

#### HTTP Request & Response Examples

**Successful Request (Valid Credentials):**

To supply Basic Auth credentials, the client sends an `Authorization` header with a Base64-encoded string of `username:password` (in this case, `admin:secret`).

_Request:_

```http
GET /basic-auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"message": "Hello, admin"}
```

**Failed Request (Invalid Credentials):**

_Request:_

```http
GET /basic-auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json
WWW-Authenticate: Basic

{"detail": "Incorrect username or password"}
```

---

### Example 5: Combining Multiple Security Schemes

Sometimes, you may need to support more than one authentication method. The following example demonstrates how to combine API key and OAuth2 token authentication.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Security, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader, OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()

api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-Key", auto_error=False)
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token", auto_error=False)

def get_current_user(
    api_key: str = Security(api_key_header),
    token: str = Security(oauth2_scheme)
):
    if api_key == "secret-api-key":
        return {"auth_method": "api_key", "user": "api_user"}
    elif token == "secret-oauth-token":
        return {"auth_method": "oauth2", "user": "oauth_user"}
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Could not validate credentials",
    )

@app.get("/multi-auth")
def multi_auth(current_user: dict = Security(get_current_user)):
    return {"message": "Authenticated", "user": current_user}
```

#### HTTP Request & Response Examples

**Request Using API Key:**

_Request:_

```http
GET /multi-auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-API-Key: secret-api-key
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"message": "Authenticated", "user": {"auth_method": "api_key", "user": "api_user"}}
```

**Request Using OAuth2 Token:**

_Request:_

```http
GET /multi-auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer secret-oauth-token
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"message": "Authenticated", "user": {"auth_method": "oauth2", "user": "oauth_user"}}
```

**Request with Neither Valid API Key nor Valid Token:**

_Request:_

```http
GET /multi-auth HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-API-Key: wrong-key
Authorization: Bearer wrong-token
```

_Response:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json

{"detail": "Could not validate credentials"}
```

## Comparison

### Authentication Methods

FastAPI supports multiple authentication methods through `fastapi.Security`, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. The table below provides a comparison of different authentication strategies, including their implementation, data sources, and key considerations.

| Authentication Method | Implementation                             | Typical Data Source                                  | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                                                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API Key               | `APIKeyHeader` or `APIKeyQuery`            | Custom header or query parameter                     | Simple to implement; auto-documented in OpenAPI; minimal setup         | Static keys; less granular control; key leakage risk                                           |
| OAuth2 (Password Bearer) | `OAuth2PasswordBearer`                    | Bearer token in the `Authorization` header           | Supports token expiration and refresh; widely adopted standard         | Requires token generation and management; more complex to implement                            |
| OAuth2 with Scopes    | `OAuth2PasswordBearer` with scope validation | Bearer token with defined scopes                     | Granular access control with scope-based authorization; self-documenting | Increased complexity in managing and validating scopes                                         |
| HTTP Basic            | `HTTPBasic`                                | Base64-encoded `username:password` in the `Authorization` header | Simple and straightforward; good for low-risk or internal APIs         | Credentials sent with every request; must use HTTPS; no support for fine-grained permissions    |
| Combined Methods      | Custom dependency combining multiple schemes | Varies (e.g., header for API key, bearer token for OAuth2) | Flexibility for clients; fallback options if one method fails            | Added complexity; potential ambiguity in determining the active authentication method          |

### `fastapi.Security` and `fastapi.Depends`

While `fastapi.Security` and `fastapi.Depends` share some similarities, `fastapi.Security` is specifically designed for authentication and authorization purposes. Below is a comparison of their key differences.

| **Feature**                           | **`fastapi.Security`**                                               | **`fastapi.Depends`**                                      |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use**                       | Security and authorization (e.g., API keys, OAuth2, HTTP Basic)      | General dependency injection                             |
| **Automatic OpenAPI Documentation**   | Yes – Security schemes are included automatically                    | No – Used for general dependencies without security focus  |
| **Scope Support**                     | Yes – Supports OAuth2 scopes                                         | No                                                         |
| **Intended for Security**             | Yes – Specifically designed for security-related logic               | No – More general-purpose                                  |
| **Override Behavior in Tests**        | Both can be overridden for testing purposes                          | Both can be overridden                                     |

By choosing the right authentication method and leveraging `fastapi.Security`, you can implement secure, scalable, and well-documented authentication mechanisms in your FastAPI applications.

---

## Best Practices

- **Separate Security Logic:** Isolate your security mechanisms in dedicated dependency functions for clarity and reuse.
- **Utilize Scopes When Needed:** If using OAuth2, define and validate scopes to control access more granularly.
- **Automatic Documentation:** Take advantage of the automatic integration of security schemes in the OpenAPI docs by using `Security`.
- **Combine Methods Carefully:** When combining multiple security schemes, ensure that your logic clearly defines the fallback or priority.
- **Test Extensively:** Override security dependencies in your tests to simulate various authentication scenarios.
